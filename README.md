## Twitter Bot Detection Model Using Logistic Regression

# Objective:
Develop a machine learning model to detect Twitter bots, utilizing the logistic regression algorithm for binary classification (bot or human).

# Data Collection:
Data Source: Collect a labeled dataset of Twitter users, where each user is tagged as either a bot or a human.
Features: Extract relevant features such as:
User ID: Unique identifier for each user.
Username: The handle or name of the user.
Tweet: Content of the user's tweet.
Retweet Count: Number of retweets the user's tweet has received.
Mention Count: Number of mentions in the user's tweets.
Follower Count: Number of followers the user has.
Verified: Whether the user is verified (boolean).
Bot Label: Label indicating if the user is a bot (1) or human (0).
Location: Location information of the user.
Created At: Account creation date.
Hashtags: Number of hashtags used in the user's tweets.

# Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning: Remove any missing or irrelevant data.
Feature Engineering:
Convert categorical features (e.g., presence of profile picture) into numerical format.
Normalize numerical features to a consistent scale.
Splitting Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

# Model Development:
Algorithm Selection: Choose logistic regression due to its simplicity and effectiveness for binary classification tasks.
Training:
Use the training data to fit the logistic regression model.
Optimize the model parameters to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss function.
Evaluation:
Validate the model using the testing dataset.
Calculate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the modelâ€™s effectiveness.
